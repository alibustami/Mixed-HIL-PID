You have all the scripts in the `mixed_hil_pid` scripts, I want this directory to contain only 5 scripts:
1) `mixed_hil_rerun.py`
2) `bo_hil_rerun.py`
3) `de_hil_rerun.py`
4) `de_vanilla_rerun.py`
5) `bo_vanilla_rerun.py`

the rerun modules should rerun each experiment upon a given number 
The TUI module should run these mentioned scripts for X amount of experiments

(Experiment are built from a stack of iterations - so don’t mix the concepts)
Also I want you to fill the other modules in the `mixed_hil_pid`:
- `utils.py` : put the functions and any portion of the code that is repeated and call it from there
- `logger.py` should contain the logging logic of the code
- `experiment_executor.py`: contain the logic of running an experiment (either for the mixed approach, or the bo_hil/de_hil or bo_vanilla/de_vanilla) it should handle all the cases
- `gui.py`: contain the GUI stuff
- `metrics.py`: the metric logic
- `simulator.py`: contain the simulation of the pybullet codes

Also update the TUI to contain a text field to ask the user how many experiments they want to run

Note:
- No change to the logic of the code changes are expected (red line)
- No change to the logging logic of the experiments (red line)
- the changes should be to the system architecture
- you can create as much modules as you think is needed in the `mixed_hil_pid` directory to modularize the system architecture of the repo.
